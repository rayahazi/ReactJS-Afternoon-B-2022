### React vs React-native

##### react.js

- A js library for building UI's
- React usually is used with web development.
- React.Dom.Render(...) : adds the web support. We can instead render data to anywhere else.

##### react native

- A collection of special react components. (View, Text)
- components are compiled to native widgets.
- Gives access to native platform API's exposed to JS. (camera, location etc..).

### How does reactJS work?

React will create virtual DOM in memory.

It allows us to change only the necessary elements. (not all the page).
react only changes what needs to be changed.
