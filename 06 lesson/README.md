# Lifecycle methods in a class:

* Each component(class) in react has lifecycle. 
* We have 3 stages where we can see and change the values: 
    1. Mounting - הרכבה - inserts elements to the DOM (4 methods)
    2. Updating - עדכון - update elements in the DOM (5 methods)
    3. Unmounting - פירוק - remove component or elements from the DOM.

> the `render()` method is always a must!
